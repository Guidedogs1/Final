 	 <p id ="p01"> <i>Super Smash Bros. </i> Ultimate offers a lot out of the box. All 103 stages and over 700 music tracks are available from the moment you turn on the game. What isn’t available at the start, however — and this is a big one — is every fighter. While the full roster includes 74 playable characters at launch (76 if you count Pokémon Trainer’s three Pokémon separately), only eight are unlocked from the get-go. So many worlds to play in, so few combatants. 
 	 <br>
 	 There are myriad ways to unlock fighters — the single unifying gist is that the more you play <i> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </i> in any mode, the more characters you unlock — but there is one method that is <i> much </i> faster than others, though it requires you to spend a bit more time in the Nintendo Switch’s menus. </p>
